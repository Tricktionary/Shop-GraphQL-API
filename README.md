### Shopify Challenge 2019

##Problem Requirements 

Every product should have a title, price, and inventory_count.

Querying for all products should support passing an argument to only return products with available inventory. 

Products should be able to be "purchased" which should reduce the inventory by 1. Products with no inventory cannot be purchased.

**Extra Credit** 

Fit these product purchases into the context of a simple shopping cart. 

That means purchasing a product requires first creating a cart, adding products to the cart, and then "completing" the cart.
The cart should contain a list of all included products, a total dollar amount (the total value of all products), and product inventory shouldn't reduce until after a cart has been completed.

**Extra Extra Credit**

Bonus points for making your API (at least partly) secure, writing documentation that doesnâ€™t suck, including unit tests, and/or building your API using GraphQL.

## Context
